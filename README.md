## Crypto-Tracker 

Crypto tracker is a cryptocurrency portfolio-tracker that allows users to enter their exchange-API credentials and view important performance-related stats. This includes balance, profit and loss, trades, and other metrics for 100s of cryptocurrencies across many major exchanges. This project is an expiriment in utilizing API data from several sources and manipulating and displaying data using client-side logic. This app is built with React.js, CCXT trading library, D3 (charts) and an express backend. Crypto-Tracker is currently under heavy development and is using mock data for user information.
